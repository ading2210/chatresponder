## ChatResponder

A Fabric 1.18.2 mod that responds to certain chat messages via regex. Once a match is found, it can run a list of commands or chat messages. You can also specify a custom delay for those messages (in milliseconds). 

### Some documentation:

You add or remove regex items through the options menu, which you can access from the regular Minecraft options menu. You can also enable/disable the mod and reload the config from there. 

The mod compares each regex string against each incoming chat message (stripped of any formatting codes) and runs a series of commands that you can specify. You can specify a delay for each message, which runs *before* the command is executed.
